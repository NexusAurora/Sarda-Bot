# SARDA: Search and Rescue Deployable Robotic Unit

## Project Overview

SARDA (Search and Rescue Deployable Robotic Unit) is a cutting-edge robotic system designed to assist first responders in search and rescue operations in hazardous environments. The goal of this project is to create a safer, more efficient, and reliable infrastructure that can withstand disasters while minimizing casualties.

When deployed, SARDA maps and renders a dynamic, color-coded 3D model of its surroundings, collecting critical environmental data such as temperature and humidity. This information is vital for first responders to make informed decisions during emergencies.

## Objectives

- Develop a deployable robotic unit for search and rescue operations.
- Create a dynamic 3D model of the environment using real-time data.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the robotic unit.
- Utilize advanced technologies such as ray tracing for realistic visual representation.

## Features

- **3D Mapping**: Generates a real-time 3D model of the disaster site.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Collects data on temperature, humidity, and smoke levels.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive controls for navigating and interacting with the 3D environment.
- **Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of the robotic unit that can be controlled from the software.
- **Animation and Visual Effects**: Smooth animations and realistic lighting effects using ray tracing.

## Materials and Tools Used

- Arduino Nano for control systems
- Custom DC motors for mobility
- Laminated fiber for the robot chassis
- 3D Studio Max for model design
- Unreal Engine for environment rendering
- Adobe XD for user interface design
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Development Process

1. **Initial Setup**: Gathered materials and set up the Arduino Nano for the first time.
2. **Chassis Construction**: Built the robot's body using laminated fiber and custom designs.
3. **Motor Integration**: Soldered connections for DC motors and tested motor drivers.
4. **Software Development**: Created a shared GitHub repository for collaborative coding.
5. **3D Environment Design**: Developed a visually appealing environment with accurate lighting and shadows.
6. **Camera Controls**: Implemented user controls for navigating the 3D scene.
7. **Animation**: Designed animations for dynamic elements in the environment.
8. **User Interface**: Developed a heads-up display (HUD) for real-time data visualization.
9. **Testing and Refinement**: Rigorous testing of the robotic unit and software before the exhibition.

## Exhibition

On August 27, 2022, we presented SARDA at the National Science Fair Exhibition. The project received positive feedback from attendees, including students, professors, and military personnel. We were honored to receive the grand prize for our efforts, marking a successful culmination of our hard work.

## Future Work

While SARDA has been successfully developed and showcased, there are plans for further enhancements, including:

- Improved sensor integration for more accurate environmental data.
- Advanced AI algorithms for autonomous navigation and decision-making.
- Enhanced user interface features for better user experience.
